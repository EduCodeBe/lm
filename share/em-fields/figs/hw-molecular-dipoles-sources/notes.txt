Notes on the method for making these graphics:

Similar to the ones in molecular-dipoles-sources.

Avogadro crashed on most of the molfiles I tried to read, and also I couldn't
find molfiles for many of the molecules I wanted. For this reason, I used SF6 as
a stand-in for PCl52-, and hand-edited the bitmapped output afterward to get
rid of one atom.

Wanted to do some of the other cool ones in
 https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Chemical_Bonding/Lewis_Theory_of_Bonding/Geometry_of_Molecules
but couldn't get them to work for the above reasons.

I fiddled with the output in GIMP to produce
  hw-molecular-dipoles-bitmap-edited.jpg ,
so that file is in git's version control.
