(a) A line of charge with density $\lambda$ is moving at velocity $v$
in the direction parallel to its own length. Find the
current.\hwendpart
(b) Suppose that there is an externally imposed
magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to the line of charge, which we
can think of as a wire.  Consider a portion of
the wire of length $\ell$, and show that the force per unit length is
$F/\ell=IB$, as claimed on
p.~\pageref{b-force-on-wire-claim}.\index{force!on a wire in a
magnetic field}
