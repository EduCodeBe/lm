The electric and magnetic fields have different units, so we can't really say whether
an electric field is equal in strength to a magnetic field. However, we could consider
them to be ``morally equal'' if their energy densities are equal. Find the value of
$E/B$ in this case.\answercheck

\hwremark{With hindsight, it was a mistake to design the SI so that $E$ and $B$
had different units. There are in fact other systems of units, such as the cgs system,
in which their units are the same, and the expressions for their energy densities have
the same constant factor in front.}
