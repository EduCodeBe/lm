Example \ref{eg:pillbox} on p.~\pageref{eg:pillbox} described the choice of a Gaussian surface
in order to calculate the electric field of a uniformly charged plane, with charge
density $\sigma$ in units of coulombs per square meter. (a) Complete the calculation in order
to find the field. (b) Check that the units of your answer make sense.<% hw_solution %>
