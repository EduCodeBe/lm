(a) Given that the argument of a complex number $z$ equals $\theta$,
what is the argument of $1/z$?\\
For the remainder of this problem, let
$z=\sqrt{3}+i$. Sketch the location of this point in the
complex plane. Find (b) $|z|$, (c) $\operatorname{arg} z$ in degrees,
(d) $|1/z|$, (e) $\operatorname{arg}(1/z)$ in degrees,
and (f) the imaginary part of $1/z$. Draw $1/z$ on your
sketch.\\
You should be able to
do all of these in your head, just by staring at the sketch.
Don't do them by manipulating complex numbers in $a+bi$ form,
because that's actually harder, and the purpose of this
exercise is to get you used to doing it using the magnitude
and argument.\answercheck
