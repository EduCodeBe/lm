An electric dipole is composed of charges $\pm q$ ($q>0$), each with mass $m$,
at the ends of a massless rod of length $\ell$. The dipole is initially
released in an orientation perpendicular to the ambient electric field
of magnitude $E$. (a) Find its maximum angular velocity $\omega$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Comment on the interpretation of the sign of your result.\hwendpart
(c) Show that the units of your answer make sense.\hwendpart
(d) Discuss how your answer depends on all four
variables, and show that it makes sense. That is, for each
variable, discuss what would happen to the result if you
changed it while keeping the other two variables constant.
Would a bigger value give a smaller result, or a bigger
result? Once you've figured out this \emph{mathematical}
relationship, show that it makes sense \emph{physically}.\hwendpart
