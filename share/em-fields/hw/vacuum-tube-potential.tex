A vacuum tube, in its simplest conceptual form, is a parallel-plate
capacitor enclosed in a glass tube so that all the air can be pumped
out. A potential difference is applied, and if the negative plate is
heated, some electrons will spontaneously pop out of the metal and be
accelerated across the gap. The density of the electrons in flight is
nonuniform because of their acceleration, and an analysis by
Richardson around 1901 showed that the potential would have the form
$\phi=c x^{4/3}$, where $c$ is a constant. Find the electric
field.\answercheck
