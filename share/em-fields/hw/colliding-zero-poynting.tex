The figure shows two electromagnetic plane waves, with their associated Poynting vectors.
The two waves are equal in intensity.
Suppose that these two waves are now superimposed at the same point in space.
(a) Find the total Poynting vector by adding the two Poynting vectors.\\
(b) Find the total Poynting vector by adding the fields, then computing the
Poynting vector from the total.\\
(c) Show that the results from the two methods are consistent with each other,
and give a physical interpretation.<% hw_solution %>
