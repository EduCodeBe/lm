(a) A capacitance $C$ and an inductance $L$ are connected in parallel. Show that
there is a frequency at which no current at all flows through this system as a whole in response to an
externally applied voltage. Find the frequency. This is a ``notch'' or ``band reject'' filter.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) There will inevitably be some stray resistance. How does this affect the situation described above?
