Electronic ink is a technology, used in electronic book readers such
as the Amazon Kindle, for displaying images. The figure shows a side
view of a cross-section of a small part of the screen, cutting through one row of
pixels.  Each pixel consists of a tiny capacitor, about 0.1 mm in
height, with a capsule inside it. The capsule contains black and white
particles of pigments which have opposite charges. When a voltage is
applied to the capacitor, the particles sort themselves out in
opposite directions. When the white particles are on top, the pixel
appears like white paper when viewed from above. When the black
particles are on top, it appears like a dot of black ink. An electric
field of about $1.5\times10^5\ \zu{V}/\zu{m}$ is needed in order to
make the particles move. Estimate the voltage that has to be applied
to the capacitor.\answercheck
