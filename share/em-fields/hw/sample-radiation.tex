The figure depicts the electric fields in
the radiation pattern of a certain type of radio antenna, shown in the photo superimposed
in the background. Consider the small region of space indicated by the white square.
As the waves pass through this area, spreading out like ripples from the antenna, they are moving up and to the right. We therefore
expect that their momentum density should be up and to the right. For the reasons discussed on
p.~\pageref{waves-not-pure-e-or-b}, the radio wave cannot be purely electric; it
must contain a magnetic field as well. For convenience in discussion, a coordinate system
is given below the diagram, with the $x$ axis pointing in the direction of propagation.
Consider the following six possibilities
for the direction of the magnetic field in the area of the white square: $+x$, $-x$,
$+y$, $-y$, $+z$, and $-z$. Of these, which are not possible because they don't
produce a momentum density in the $+x$ direction?
