The figure shows a sheet of current coming out of the page. Such a sheet can be characterized by a current density $\eta$, which has
units of A/m. The figure shows magnetic field vectors in the $\pm x$ directions, with equal magnitudes above and below the sheet.
In general, however, this symmetry need not exist.
We could always add a constant magnetic field to the whole field pattern and get another equally valid solution
of Maxwell's equations. The only thing we can actually determine is $\Delta B_x$, the difference in the horizontal field between the
top and bottom of the sheet.\\
(a) Find $\Delta B_x$ in terms of $\eta$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) In the symmetric case shown in the figure,
what can you say about the pressure or tension experienced by the sheet, using the visual modes of reasoning
from sec.~\ref{subsec:pressure-of-em-fields}, p.~\pageref{subsec:pressure-of-em-fields}? If the sheet has no
structural strength, what will it do?
