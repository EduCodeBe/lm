Let the interior field of a certain infinite solenoid be $B_\zu{o}$.
Now suppose that we build a finite solenoid with all the same design parameters
except that it has a finite length, and consider the field $B$ at a point on
the axis. Show by integrating the field of a loop of current that
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{B}{B_\zu{o}} = \frac{\cos\theta_1-\cos\theta_2}{2},
\end{equation*}
where the angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are defined in the figure.
