Suppose a capacitor consists of two parallel metal plates with area
$A$, and the gap between them is $h$. The gap is small compared to the
dimensions of the plates. Since the plates are metal, the charges on
each plate are free to move, and will tend to cluster themselves more
densely near the edges due to the mutual repulsion of the other
charges in the same plate. However, it turns out that if the gap is
small, this is a small effect, so we can get away with assuming
uniform charge density on each plate.  Find the field between the
plates when the charges on the plates are $q$ and $-q$. Use the result
of problem \ref{hw:pillbox}, which has a solution in the back of the
book.\answercheck
