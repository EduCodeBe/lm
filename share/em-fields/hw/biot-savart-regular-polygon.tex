A regular polygon with $n$ sides can be inscribed within a circle of radius
$R$ and can have a circle 
inscribed inside it with radius $h$. Let $\rho=\sqrt{hR}$ be the geometric mean of these two
radii. A current loop is constructed in the shape of a regular $n$-gon.
Show that the magnetic field at the center can be calculated in a simple way from
the perimeter and $\rho$, and make sense of the result in the extreme cases $n=2$ 
(a degenerate polygon enclosing no area) and $n\rightarrow\infty$.
