Mayor Max is mayor of Idyllwild, California. He is a golden
retriever. Because some of his fans are a little crazy, his security detail
carefully examines all packages sent to him. The figure shows a cubical box he's
received, which contains the electric field pattern indicated by the
drawing of the field lines. (a) Where are electric charges located in the
box, and what are their signs? (b) Compare the strength of the electric
field at the points marked with the diamond and the star. Is there charge
at these points? (c) What is the total charge of the box?
