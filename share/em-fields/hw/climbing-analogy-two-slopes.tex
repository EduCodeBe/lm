The figure shows a rock climbing route lying in a vertical plane.
It can be approximated by two line segments. Superimposed on the climb
is a grid of squares with sides of length $\ell$. The gravitational field
is $g$.\\
(a) Continuing the gravitational
analogy from problem \ref{hw:two-climbing-routes}, find
$\phi_B-\phi_A$ and $\phi_C-\phi_B$, where the ``electric potential''
$\phi$ is the energy per unit mass.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) In the electrical version of this situation, the ``height'' is
not a physical distance in space at all, so we could say that
only the horizontal segments of the squares represent
distances, and the situation is effectively one-dimensional.
Find the ratio of the ``electric fields'' $E_{BC}/E_{AB}$.\answercheck
