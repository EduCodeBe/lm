A U-shaped wire makes electrical contact with a second, straight wiref, of length $\ell$, which rolls along it to the
right at velocity $v$,
as shown in the figure. The whole thing is immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$, which is
perpendicular to the plane of the circuit. The resistance $R$ of the rolling wire is much
greater than that of the U.\\
(a) Use Amp\`{e}re's law to find the current through the wire.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Use conservation of energy to find the direction of the force on the wire.\hwendpart
(c) Verify the direction of the force using right-hand rules.\hwendpart
(d) Find the magnitude of the force acting on the wire.\answercheck\hwendpart
(e) Consider how the answer to part a would have changed if the direction of the field had been
reversed, and also do the case where the direction of the rolling wire's motion is reversed.
Verify that this is in agreement with your answer to part c.
