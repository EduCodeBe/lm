The magnetized spheres in the figure are like the examples in
problem \ref{hw:spherical-magnets-tilted}, but tilted at
45 degrees, so that there is a lower level of symmetry.
Find the direction of the force that the left-hand magnet
makes on the right-hand magnet, expressed as an angle
counterclockwise from the $x$ axis, which points to the
right.\answercheck
