(a) Carry out the algebra in example \ref{eg:l-solenoid},
p.~\pageref{eg:l-solenoid}, to show that the inductance
of an ideal solenoid is $(4\pi k/c^2)N^2A/\ell$. (For a
real solenoid, the interior field will be smaller and
nonuniform, and the exterior field will be nonzero.)\\
(b) A particular solenoid used in my lab classes has
roughly $N=3000$, $\ell=10\ \zu{cm}$, and a diameter
of about 10 cm. Estimate its inductance. This will be
only a rough estimate, because the solenoid is not very
long compared to its diameter, and is therefore very nonideal.
