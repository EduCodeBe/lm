<% hw_solution %> The figure shows two climbing routes at Tahquitz Rock, near Idyllwild, California.
They begin and end at the same point. Compare the work done against gravity by the
same climber climbing the two routes. Why would it be of interest to state these
figures instead as the work per kilogram of body mass, in units of J/kg? In the analogy with electrical
fields, what would these units be?
