(a) Show that the energy in the electric field of a point charge
        is infinite! Does the integral diverge at small distances, at large
        distances, or both? <% hw_hint("epointinfty") %>\hwendpart[4]
        (b) Now calculate the energy in the electric field of a uniformly
        charged sphere with radius $b$. Based on the shell theorem,
        it can be shown that the field for $r>b$ is the same as for
        a point charge, while the field for $r<b$ is $kqr/b^3$.

        \hwremark{The calculation in part a seems to show that infinite energy
        would be required in order to create a charged, pointlike particle.
        However, there are processes that, for example,
        create electron-positron pairs, and these processes don't require
        infinite energy. According to Einstein's famous equation
        $E=mc^2$, the energy required to create such a pair should only
        be $2mc^2$, which is finite.}
