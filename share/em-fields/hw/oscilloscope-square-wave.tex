The figure shows an oscilloscope trace for a signal that is meant to
be a square wave. Of course a real-life signal can never be a perfect,
idealized shape such as a square wave. Here we see that both the
leading and trailing edges look like exponential functions.
Suppose that the time constant of these exponentials is 5 ms
(about 1/10 of a division), the resistance in the circuit is
$1.0\ \Omega$, and the exponential behavior is due to a
stray capacitance in series with the resistance. Estimate the
stray capacitance.\answercheck
