The figure shows an oscilloscope trace for a signal that is meant to
be a square wave. Of course a real-life signal can never be a perfect,
idealized shape such as a square wave. Here we see that both the
leading and trailing edges look like exponential functions.
Suppose that the time constant of these exponentials is 5 ms
(about 1/10 of a division), the resistance in the circuit is
$1.0\ \Omega$, and the exponential behavior is due to a
stray capacitance in series with the resistance.\\
(a) Estimate the stray capacitance.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Verify directly that the units of your answer work out to be
farads, if the farad is defined by the definition of capacitance
$U=q^2/2C$.
