Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen in which the nucleus has one proton
and one neutron. The nucleus is referred to as a deuteron.
The deuteron has angular momentum and magnetic moment
\begin{align*}
  L &= 1.05457\times10^{-34}\ \junit\unitdot\sunit \qquad \text{and} \\
  m &= 4.33 \times10^{-27}\ \zu{A}\unitdot\munit^2.
\end{align*}
Find the $g$ factor of the deuteron. You should find that it roughly
makes sense if we consider the nucleus as two pointlike particles with
identical masses but with one particle's charge being zero.\answercheck
