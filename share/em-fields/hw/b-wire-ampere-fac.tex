The equation $B=(k/c^2)\cdot 2kI/r$ for the magnetic field of a long, straight wire was derived in
in examples \ref{eg:field-of-wire}, p.~\pageref{eg:field-of-wire}, (the form of the equation) and
\ref{eg:b-wire}, p.~\pageref{eg:b-wire} (the factor of 2).\index{magnetic field!long, straight wire!found using Amp\`{e}re's law}
Derive the equation using Amp\`{e}re's law. (Cf.~also problem \ref{hw:biot-savart-wire-stepwise},
p.~\pageref{hw:biot-savart-wire-stepwise}, using the Biot-Savart law.)
