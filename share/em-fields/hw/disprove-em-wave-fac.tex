<% hw_solution %> A plane electromagnetic wave is supposed to have its electric and magnetic fields
perpendicular to each other.
Suppose someone claims they can make an electromagnetic wave in which the electric
and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the direction of propagation, but parallel to each other.
We have already ruled out such a possibility on p.~\pageref{subsec:e-b-perp} based on conservation of energy.
Give a different proof by using Maxwell's equations.
