        (a) An infinite strip of width $b$ has a surface charge density $\sigma$.
        Find the field at a point at a distance $z$ from the strip,
        lying in the plane perpendicularly bisecting the strip.

        (b) Show that this expression has the
        correct behavior in the limit where $z$ approaches zero,
        and also in the limit of $z\gg b$.
