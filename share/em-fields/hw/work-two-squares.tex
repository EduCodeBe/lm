The figure shows two different field patterns.\\
(a) In the first field pattern,
suppose that moving a charge ``uphill'' along path ABD requires that work be done against
the electric field in the amount of one joule per coulomb. How much work would have to
be done per unit charge along path ACD?\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) In the second figure, the work per unit charge along EFH is 2 J/C. What would it
be along EGH?\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) Can an electric potential $\phi$ be defined for field pattern a? For b?
