The radioactive decay of the neutron was discussed on p.~\pageref{neutron-beta-decay}. A similar process is
electron capture,
\begin{equation*}
  \text{proton} + \text{electron} \rightarrow \text{neutron} + \text{neutrino}.
\end{equation*}
The only particle here that has not been previously mentioned is the neutrino, but as you might
guess, it's electrically neutral, just like the antineutrino. Verify that electric charge is
conserved in this type of decay.

\hwremark{Luckily for us, this process doesn't occur spontaneously in the hydrogen atom --- it requires
an input of energy to make it go. It does occur spontaneously, however, for some nuclei.}
