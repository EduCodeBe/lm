At a frequency of 53.1 kHz, a certain series LR circuit has an impedance of $1.6\ \zu{k}\Omega+(1.2\ \zu{k}\Omega)i$.
Suppose that instead we want to achieve the same impedance using two circuit elements in parallel.
What must the elements be? As a check on your answer, you should find that both values are round numbers
when rounded off to the correct number of significant figures.
