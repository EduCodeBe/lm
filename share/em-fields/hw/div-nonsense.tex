Surfers on the western coasts of Europe in the winter of 2013-2014
experienced waves of historic proportions, up to 18 meters tall.
Meteorologists deal with various quantities that are functions of
position and can be plotted on a map.  Some of these quantities, such
as wave height, temperature, and pressure, are scalars. Others, such
as wind velocity and ocean currents, are vectors, which we would
notate in boldface.  The map in the figure, from Ireland in December
2013, superimposes plots of wave height (colors) and wind velocity
(arrows). Explain why each of the following expressions doesn't make
sense for a meteorologist to talk about, purely on ``grammatical'' grounds.
