An electron has a nonzero magnetic dipole moment, which is aligned
with its spin. Suppose that at distance $r$, at a certain point
in space relative to an electron, the magnetic field has magnitude
$B$. Find the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point
lying at distance $10r$, along the same line.\answercheck
