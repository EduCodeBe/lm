(a) The first figure shows a cube with six sides, including a floor
underneath.  Each square has sides of length $b$ and is a current loop
carrying current $I$ in the same orientation, i.e., an ant exploring
the outside surface and inspecting all the current loops will see each
current rotating in the same direction as it stands on that panel of
the box. Why is the total dipole moment not $6Ib^2$?\\

(b) The second figure shows a landscape consisting of a $5\times5$
grid of squares, interrupted by a ``little house on the prairie'' in
the middle: a cube with four walls and a roof. The cube does not have
a floor, so the total area is $29b^2$. Find the magnitude of the total
magnetic dipole moment.\answercheck

\hwremark{This is not quite as silly and artificial as it might seem. In condensed
matter physics, it's common to have things like surface layers of dipoles, and
it's also common to have defects in such a surface such as bumps and scratches.}
