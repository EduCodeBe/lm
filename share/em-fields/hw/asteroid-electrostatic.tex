The gravitational field $g$ of a typical asteroid is so weak that it is just a loose pile
of rubble, gravel, and dust. In this environment, the ambient electric field
$E$ can make a strong enough force on a small  particle of dust so that it competes
on fairly even terms with gravity.\\
(a) Suppose that a particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$
is disturbed so that it is shot upward from the surface with initial velocity $v$.
Find the height $h$ to which it rises. Use a coordinate system in which up is
positive, so that $g$ will be negative, $v$ and $h$ positive, and $E$ either positive or
negative depending on the direction of the field.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Evaluate your result for $v=1.0\times10^{-1}\ \munit/\sunit$ and
the following data, which are meant to be fairly
realistic for an asteroid the size of a football field: $g=-1.0\times10^{-4}\ \munit/\sunit^2$,
$E=40\ \zu{V}/\munit$, $m=1.0\times10^{-8}\ \kgunit$, $q=1.0\times10^{-14}\ \zu{C}$.\answercheck\hwendpart
