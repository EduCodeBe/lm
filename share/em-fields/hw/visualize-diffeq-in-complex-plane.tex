<% hw_solution %> One solution of the differential equation
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der^4 x}{\der t^4} - 16 x = 0
\end{equation*}
is the function $x(t)=\sin 2t$. Visualize this function as
a point in the complex plane, and use the system of analogies
on p.~\pageref{table-of-complex-plane-analogies} to explain
why this is a solution to the differential equation.
