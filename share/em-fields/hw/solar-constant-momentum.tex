The solar constant is defined as the average flux of electromagnetic energy coming from the sun
to the earth, per square meter. It equals $1.36\ \zu{kW}/\munit^2$. Now imagine, as suggested
by the figure, a giant cubical volume of space, 100 km on a side. Find the total momentum of
the electromagnetic energy inside this cube. You should find that it is on the same order
of magnitude as the momentum of a baseball thrown casually.\answercheck
