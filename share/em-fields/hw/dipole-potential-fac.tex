In example \ref{eg:e-dipole-mid-plane},
p.~\pageref{eg:e-dipole-mid-plane}, we showed that the distant electric field
of an electric dipole, in its mid-plane, was proportional to $r^{-3}$,
and in problem
\ref{hw:dipole-axis}, p.~\pageref{hw:dipole-axis}, you showed that this
is also true on the dipole's axis. It is in fact true for points along any line
passing through an electric dipole that its distant field is $E=br^{-3}$,
with the constant factor $b$ differing by a unitless factor depending on the
orientation of the line. Find the corresponding electric potential $\phi$.\index{dipole!electric!potential of}
