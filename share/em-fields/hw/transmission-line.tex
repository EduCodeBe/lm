The photo shows the cross-section of an electrical transmission line designed to be hung
in the air between towers. To prevent the cable from sagging too much, there is a central
core of radius $a$ made of a carbon-glass composite, which is stronger and lighter than steel, but
nonconductive. Surrounding this is a conducting aluminum sheath with outer radius $b$. Because the
frequency is low, the current density is nearly uniform.\\
(a) If the cable carries current $I$, find the magnitude of the current density $\vc{j}$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Evaluate your answer numerically for $a=4.76\ \zu{mm}$ and $b=14.07\ \zu{mm}$, at this cable's
nominal current-carrying capacity of $1.00\ \zu{kA}$.\answercheck\hwendpart
