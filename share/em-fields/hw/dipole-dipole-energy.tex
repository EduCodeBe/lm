Magnetic dipole 1 has its dipole moment oriented along the $z$ axis, so that
its $z$ component $m_1$ is either positive or negative, and its $x$ and $y$ components
are zero. It interacts with a second dipole $m_2$, also purely along the $z$ axis.
They lie on the $x$ axis at distance $r$ from one another. Find the energy of their
interaction with each other. What is their stable orientation? You should find
that this result agrees with experience from playing with a pair of bar magnets.\answercheck
