Consider the following four potentials, which exist in some region of the positive $x$ axis:
\begin{align*}
  \phi_1 &= ax \\
  \phi_2 &= ax+b \\
  \phi_3 &= \frac{a}{x} \\
  \phi_4 &= \frac{a}{x}+b.
\end{align*}
In each case, find the corresponding electric field, and give physical
interpretations of what is going on physically and of the constants
$a$ and $b$.
