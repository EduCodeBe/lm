The figure shows three molecules. You don't actually need to know any chemistry to do
this problem, but in case you're interested, they're $\zu{PCl}_5^{2-}$,
$\zu{H}_3\zu{O}^+$, and $\zu{PF}_5$, respectively. If you look carefully at the figure,
you should be able to see that molecule 1 is a pyramid, 2 is not planar, and
in 3 there are three atoms in a line plus three atoms arranged to form an equilateral
triangle in a perpendicular plane. Use symmetry arguments to determine which of
these molecules have zero electric dipole moments.
