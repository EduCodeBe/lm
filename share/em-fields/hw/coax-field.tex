(a) A coaxial cable consists of a cylindrical inner conductor with
radius $a$ and an outer one with radius $b$. If the potential
difference between the two conductors is $\Delta\phi$, find
the electric field at $a\le r\le b$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Show that your answer makes sense
when $a=b$ and when $b<a$.
