<% hw_solution %> In example \ref{eg:spark-plug} on p.~\pageref{eg:spark-plug}, we discussed the
spark plugs of a gasoline engine, which need to make an electric field of a certain
strength in order to spark. What we didn't discuss then was the very small size of the spark
gap, seen in the close-up photo. All other things being equal, the small size of the
gap would seem extremely undesirable. Special tools are required in order to measure it,
and if it gets crud on the tips, the gap can easily become clogged. Now that you
understand the relationship between the field and the potential, can you explain why
we would make the gap so small?
