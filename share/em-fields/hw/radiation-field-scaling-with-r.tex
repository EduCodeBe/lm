The figure shows a candle flame.  The light from
the flame spreads out in all directions. We pick four representative
rays from among those that happen to pass through the nearer square.
Of these four, only one passes through the square of equal area at
twice the distance. If the two equal-area squares were people's eyes,
then only one fourth of the light would go into the more distant
person's eye. In other words, the energy flux from a point source goes
like $1/r^2$. If the energy flux is an electromagnetic wave, determine
the dependence of the electric and magnetic fields on $r$.<% hw_solution %>
