Each of the following circuit elements or combination of elements is driven with a sinusoidal voltage at $\omega=1\ \zu{Hz}$.
In each case, determine the phase angle, in degrees, of the voltage relative to the current.
Define the sign of this phase to be positive if the voltage leads the current,
i.e., the phase is the same as the argument of the impedance. Ignore significant figures, i.e.,
assume that all data are exact.\\
