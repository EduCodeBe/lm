(a) Figure 1 shows the magnetic field patterns of two steel ball bearings, each of which
has been magnetized so that its interior field is uniform and points upward.
Employ reasoning similar to that used on p.~\pageref{fig:two-charges-pressure-and-tension}
in analyzing figure \figref{two-charges-pressure-and-tension} to determine the direction
of the forces that the spheres exert on each other.\hwendpart
(b) Do the same for figure 2, where the balls are oriented as before, but with their
axes collinear.\hwendpart
