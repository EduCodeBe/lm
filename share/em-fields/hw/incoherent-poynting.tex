Our intuition is that if we combine two beams of light into a single beam, traveling
in the same direction, the intensities should add. But it is not so obvious how this
can be, since the fields should add linearly, and the Poynting vector is proportional
to the \emph{square} of the fields. Suppose we superimpose two plane waves that are 
traveling in the same direction, but with random polarizations. Show that, on the average,
the intensities do add.
