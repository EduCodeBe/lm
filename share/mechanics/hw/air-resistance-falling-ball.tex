  A ball falls from a height $h$. Without air resistance, the time it takes
  to reach the floor is $\sqrt{2h/g}$. A numerical version of this calculation was given
  in program \verb@time2@ on page  \pageref{program-time2}. Now suppose
  that air resistance is not negligible. For a smooth sphere of radius $r$, moving
  at speed $v$ through air of density $\rho$, the amount of energy $\der Q$ dissipated as
  heat as the ball falls through a height $\der y$ is given (ignoring signs)
  by $\der Q = (\pi/4)\rho v^2 r^2 \der y$. Modify the program to incorporate this effect,
  and find the resulting change in the fall time in the case of a 21 g ball of radius 1.0 cm,
  falling from a height of 1.0 m. The density of air at sea level is about $1.2\ \kgunit/\munit^3$.
  Turn in a printout of both your program and its output.
  Answer: 0.34 ms.
