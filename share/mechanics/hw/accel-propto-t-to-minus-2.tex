At times $t>0$, an object has acceleration $a=ct^{-2}$, where $c$
is a constant. (a) Infer the units of $c$. (b) Find the position
as a function of time. You may find that the most difficult part
of the problem is interpreting the constants of integration and
expressing them in ways that appear to make sense in terms of
units.
