  A ball falls from a height $h$. Without air resistance, the time it takes
  to reach the floor is $\sqrt{2h/g}$. 
  Now suppose
  that air resistance is not negligible. For a smooth sphere of radius $r$, moving
  at speed $v$ through air of density $\rho$, the force of air resistance
  is $(\pi/4)\rho v^2 r^2$. Modify the program \verb@meteor@ on page  \pageref{meteorlisting} to handle this problem,
  and find the resulting change in the fall time in the case of a 21 g ball of radius 1.0 cm,
  falling from a height of 1.0 m. The density of air at sea level is about $1.2\ \kgunit/\munit^3$.
  You will need to use a very large value of \verb@n@ to achieve the required precision.
  Turn in a printout of both your program and its output.
