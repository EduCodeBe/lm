You are given a battery, a flashlight bulb, and a single
piece of wire.  Draw at least two configurations of these
items that would result in lighting up the bulb, and at
least two that would not light it.  (Don't draw schematics.)
Note that the bulb has two
electrical contacts: one is the threaded metal jacket, and
the other is the tip (at the bottom in the figure).

If you're not sure what's going on, there are a couple of ways to
check. The best is to try it in real life by either
borrowing the materials
from your instructor or scrounging the materials from around the house. (If you have
a flashlight with this type of bulb, you can remove the bulb.) Another method
is to use the simulation at \url{phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/circuit-construction-kit-dc}.
