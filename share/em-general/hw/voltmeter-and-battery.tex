<% hw_solution %> The figure shows a voltmeter being connected to a battery in three different ways. In case
some of the details are too hard to see, the readings are 1353, -1353, and 0, the rotary
dial is on a 2000 mV DC scale, and the banana plug connector on the right is the one
labeled COM.
Explain why these results are obtained.
