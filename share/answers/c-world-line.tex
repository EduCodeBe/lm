If we turn the book sideways, slopes of world-lines represent velocities
in natural units. World-line 1 has a speed less than $c$, 2 has speed $c$,
and 3 has a speed greater than $c$. Only world-line 1 could be a material object,
and only 2 could be a flash of light. Both 1 and 2 are straight lines, so both
are inertial.
