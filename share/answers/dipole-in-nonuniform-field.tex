We have $D=q\ell$ and $F_x=qb\ell=Db$. Since $b$ is the same thing, in this example,
as $\partial E_x/\partial x$, our equation for $F$ is
is consistent with the result 
m4_ifelse(__sn,1,[:of example

m4_ifelse(__fac,1,[:involving a derivative on p.~\pageref{force-on-dipole-in-nonuniform-field} :])%
and also, as claimed, depends on $q$ and $\ell$ only via $D$.
