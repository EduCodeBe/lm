(a) The region between the spheres contains an intense magnetic
field (field lines close together), which is because both spheres'
contribution to the field are downward, causing them to reinforce
and become stronger. This strong field is oriented
in such a way that there is a horizontal pressure. There is
pressure at the outside edges of the spheres as well, but the
field is weaker there (because of partial cancellation of the
fields), so the pressure there is not as strong. The result is
that the balls make forces on each other that have repulsive
horizontal components. The vertical forces cancel by symmetry,
because they can't depend on whether we flip the arrowheads
or not.\\
(b) This is similar to the first example, but now the orientation
is such that there is tension between the balls. The force is
attractive.
