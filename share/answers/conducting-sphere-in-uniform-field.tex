(a) There are positive charges on the surfaces
where the field lines begin: on the top of the 
box and the bottom of the sphere. There are negative charges
where the field lines terminate: on the bottom of the box
and the top of the sphere.
(b) The field lines are more dense at the star, so the electric
field is stronger there. There is no charge at these points,
because no field lines begin or end there.
(c) The total charge appears to be exactly zero, because
of the symmetry of the charge distribution with respect to
reflection across the horizontal mid-plane.
