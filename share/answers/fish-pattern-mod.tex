The wave pattern will look like this: \anonymousinlinefig{three-quarter-wave}.
Three quarters of a wavelength fit in the tube, so the
wavelength is three times shorter than that of the lowest-frequency
mode, in which one quarter of a wave fits. Since the wavelength is
smaller by a factor of three, the frequency is three times higher.
% fish-pattern-mod.tex differs from fish-pattern.tex in leaving out
% the extension to the higher harmonics, which is homework.
