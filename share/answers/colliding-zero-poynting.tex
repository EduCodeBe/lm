(a) The Poynting vectors cancel.\\
(b) The electric fields cancel, while the magnetic field
doubles. Since the total electric field is zero, $\vc{E}\times\vc{B}=0$,
and the Poynting vector is zero.\\
(c) Both methods give zero. This makes sense physically because
we interpret the Poynting vector as a measure of the flow of energy.
Energy is flowing in and out of the page at equal rates, so there is
zero total flow.
