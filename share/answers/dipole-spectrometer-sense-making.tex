If the dipole had been oriented horizontally, then the two attractive
forces and the two repulsive forces from the fixed charges would have 
all ended up having zero total vertical component.
(This is easiest to see based on symmetry.)
The actual orientation of that dipole was such that its negative charge
was closer to the fixed positive charge on top, and its
positive charge was closer to the fixed positive below.
This caused the net force on it from the upper fixed charge to
be upward, and also caused the net force from the lower fixed charge
to be upward.
