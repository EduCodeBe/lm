This function would be represented by the complex number 1, which lies on the positive real axis, one unit
to the right of the origin.
In this system of analogies, differentiation is represented by multiplication by $i\omega$, which here is
$2i$. Taking a fourth derivative is represented by multiplying four times by $2i$, i.e., we
take our original point, 1, and make it into $1\dot (2i)^4=16$. Satisfying the differential equation
then amounts to having $16-16\dot 1=0$, which is true.
