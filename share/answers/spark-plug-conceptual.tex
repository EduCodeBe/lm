The field may not be exactly constant, but roughly speaking, we have
$\Delta\phi = E \Delta x$, where $\Delta x$ is the gap and $\Delta\phi$
is the voltage difference that has to be applied. Because $E$ is big
(a typical number was given in
example \ref{eg:spark-plug} on p.~\pageref{eg:spark-plug}),
the voltage difference would tend to be big. Making the gap smaller
reduces the voltage difference that is required.
