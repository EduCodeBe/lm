The work done against gravity is equal to the change in gravitational potential energy,
which is the same in the two cases if the person's body weight is the same.
Stating the number in units of J/kg rather than J would be nicer, because then
the number would be a property of the paths themselves, regardless of who was
climbing along them. In the electrical analogy, charge plays the role of mass,
so the units would be J/C.
