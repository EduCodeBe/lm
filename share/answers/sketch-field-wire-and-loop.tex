1. The field pattern consists of circular loops in planes perpendicular
to the wire. This means that on the $y$ axis, it's the $z$ component that's
nonzero. Using the right-hand rule, and assuming a right-handed coordinate
system, we find that the field has a positive $z$ component for positive $y$.

2. The expression looks like $(\ldots+z^2)^{-3/2}$. Because the exponent is
negative, the function is maximized when 
the quantity inside
the parentheses is minimized, at $z=0$. We get a bell-shaped curve.
