Let the wave be propagating in the $+x$ direction, and let the fields be parallel
to the $y$ axis. Then sticking a paddlewheel into the wave to measure $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E}$
will make the wheel spin if its axle is along the $z$ axis, but the paddlewheel won't
spin at all if its axle is along $y$. That is, $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E}$ has no $y$ component.
Maxwell's equations then require that $\partial\vc{B}/\partial t$ have no $y$ component. But this
is false, because $\vc{B}$ is in the $y$ direction and varying as a function of time.
