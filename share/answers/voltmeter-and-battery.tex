In figure 1, the voltmeter is reading the difference in electrical potential between the
battery's two terminals: the potential of the positive nipple minus the potential of the negative
flat end. The meter is set up to read in millivolts, and the reading is equivalent to about 1.3 V,
which is reasonable for a nominally 1.5 V battery. In 2, the wires have been reversed, so the sign
of the potential difference is reversed. In 3, only one probe is connected. There is no way to
define an absolute voltage, only a voltage difference between two points in space, so the
meter can't possibly give a meaningful result here. The way the voltage measurement is implemented
in this particular meter causes it to read zero in this situation, but the result is not really zero,
it's an error.
