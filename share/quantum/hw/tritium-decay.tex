Americium-241 is an artificial isotope used in smoke detectors. It undergoes alpha decay, with a half-life of 432 years.
As discussed in example \ref{eg:alpha-tunneling} on page \pageref{eg:alpha-tunneling}, alpha decay can be understood
as a tunneling process, and although the barrier is not rectangular in shape, the equation for the tunneling
probability on page \pageref{tunneling-probability} can still be used as a rough guide to our thinking.
For americium-241, the tunneling probability is about $1\times10^{-29}$. % http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Nuclear/alpdec.html
Suppose that this nucleus were to decay by emitting a helium-3 nucleus instead of an alpha particle (helium-4).
Estimate the relevant tunneling probability, assuming that the total energy $E$ remains the same.
This higher probability is contrary to the empirical observation that this
nucleus is not observed to decay by ${}^3\zu{He}$ emission with any significant probability, and in general
${}^3\zu{He}$ emission is almost unknown in nature; this is mainly because the ${}^3\zu{He}$ nucleus is far less stable
than the helium-4 nucleus, and the difference in binding energy reduces the energy available for the decay.
