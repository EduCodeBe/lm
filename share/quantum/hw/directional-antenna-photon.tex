Many radio antennas are designed so that they preferentially emit or receive
electromagnetic waves in a certain direction. However, no antenna is perfectly
directional.
The wave shown in the figure represents a single photon being emitted by
an antenna at the center. The antenna is directional, so there is a stronger
wave on
the right than on the left. What is the probability that the photon will be
observed on the right?
