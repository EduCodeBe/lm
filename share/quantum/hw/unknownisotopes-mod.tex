A nuclear physicist is studying a nuclear reaction
caused in an accelerator experiment, with a beam of ions
from the accelerator striking a thin metal foil and causing
nuclear reactions when a nucleus from one of the beam ions
happens to hit one of the nuclei in the target.  After the
experiment has been running for a few hours, a few billion
radioactive atoms have been produced, embedded in the
target.  She does not know what nuclei are being produced,
but she suspects they are an isotope of some heavy element
such as Pb, Bi, Fr or U. Following one such experiment,
she takes the target foil out of the accelerator, sticks it
in front of a detector, measures the activity every 5 min,
and makes a graph (figure).  The isotopes she thinks may
have been produced are:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
isotope         & half-life (minutes)\\
$^{211}\zu{Pb}$ & 36.1\\
$^{214}\zu{Pb}$ & 26.8\\
$^{214}\zu{Bi}$ & 19.7\\
$^{223}\zu{Fr}$ & 21.8\\
$^{239}\zu{U}$ & 23.5\\
\end{tabular}

\noindent Which one is it?
