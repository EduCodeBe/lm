The ground state of the nucleus boron-10 (${}^{10}\zu{B}$) has spin $s=3$, and
is therefore degenerate.\\
(a) List the $s_z$ states and check that the number of states you get
is $2s+1$.\\
(b) Based on the spin, is the ground state of ${}^{10}\zu{B}$ a fermion, or is it a boson?\\
(c) ${}^{10}\zu{B}$ has four excited states that are bound, and these
have various spins. Could some of these states be fermionic and some bosonic?
