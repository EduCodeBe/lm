Consider the wavefunctions
\begin{align*}
  \Psi_1 &= e^{x+it} \qquad \text{and} \\
  \Psi_2 &= e^{t+ix}.
\end{align*}
To keep the writing simple, we use a system of units (not SI) such that these expressions make
sense, and in which $\hbar=1$.\\
(a) Show by direct substitution in the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (with $U=\text{constant}$)
that one of these
is a solution and the other is not.\\
(b) Make an independent argument, requiring no calculations, to the effect that the invalid
one violates one of the fundamental principles 1-5 of
