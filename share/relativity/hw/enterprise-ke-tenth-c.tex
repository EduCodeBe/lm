% This version of the problem is meant for Mod 1, where they don't know relativistic KE yet.

On p.~\pageref{rel-spaceship-impractical}, 
I remarked that accelerating a macroscopic
(i.e., not microscopic) object to relativistic speeds
would require an unreasonable amount of energy.
Suppose that the starship Enterprise from Star Trek has a mass
of $8.0\times10^7$ kg, about the same as the Queen Elizabeth 2.
Compute the kinetic energy it would have to have if it
was moving at $0.1c$. Compare with the total
energy content of the world's nuclear arsenals, which is about $10^{21}$ J.
Although you don't yet know the exact relativistic equation for kinetic energy, this
speed is small enough compared to $c$
so that based on the correspondence principle,
it's reasonable to imagine that using the Newtonian
$K=(1/2)mv^2$ will give a good approximation.\answercheck
