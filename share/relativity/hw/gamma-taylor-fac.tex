The relativistic factor
\begin{equation*} 
  \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2}},
\end{equation*} 
introduced in the text, gives the amount of length contraction and time dilation.
We express it here in units in which $c=1$. Find the first two nonvanishing terms
in its Taylor series, and show that, as claimed on p.~\pageref{gamma-taylor-claim},
the first non-constant term is of order $v^2$.
