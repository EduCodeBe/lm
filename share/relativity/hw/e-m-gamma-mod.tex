<% hw_solution %> Example \ref{eg:p-is-m-gamma-v} on p.~\pageref{eg:p-is-m-gamma-v} demonstrated
how to find the momentum $p$ of an object in terms of $m$ and $v$. This expression
was made more compact by reexpressing part of it in terms of $\mygamma$. Do a similar
calculation to find the energy $E$ in terms of $m$ along with and $v$ and/or $\mygamma$.
