Example \ref{eg:doppler}, p.~\pageref{eg:doppler}, discussed the Doppler effect.
The function $D$ discussed in that example is given by
\begin{equation*}
  D(v) = \sqrt{\frac{1+v}{1-v}},
\end{equation*}
where the velocity $v$ is expressed as a fraction of $c$.
Expand this function in a Taylor series, and find the
first two nonvanishing terms. Show that these two terms agree with the
nonrelativistic expression $1+v$, so that any relativistic effect is of higher
order in $v$.
