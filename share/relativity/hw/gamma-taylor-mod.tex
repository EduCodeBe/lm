The relativistic factor
\begin{equation*} 
  \mygamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2}},
\end{equation*} 
introduced on p.~\pageref{gamma-factor-defined}, gives the amount of length contraction and time dilation.\\
(a) Find the first two nonvanishing terms
in its Taylor series, and show that
the first non-constant term is of order $v^2$. Why would it not make sense physically to have
a term of order $v$?\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Take your expression from part a and
insert factors of $c$ in the appropriate places in order to make it valid in SI units.\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) The earth is orbiting the sun, and therefore is contracted relativistically in the
direction of its motion. Compute the amount by which its diameter shrinks in this
direction.\answercheck\hwendpart
