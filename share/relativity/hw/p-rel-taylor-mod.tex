Example \ref{eg:p-is-m-gamma-v} on p.~\pageref{eg:p-is-m-gamma-v}
showed that for an object with nonzero mass, $p=m\gamma v$.
Expand this in a Taylor series, and find the first two
nonvanishing terms.  Explain why the vanishing terms are the ones that
should vanish physically.  Show that the first term is the newtonian
expression.
