Consider the standing-wave patterns of a string of length $L$ that is fixed at both ends.
The speed of waves on the string is $v$.
Let $N$ be the number of humps in the standing wave, i.e., the number of extrema
of displacement.\\
(a) Sketch the first few patterns and label them with their values of $N$.\hwendpart
(b) As a warm-up with concrete numbers, consider the case where $L=1\ \munit$.
Find the wavelengths of the patterns you drew in part a.\hwendpart
(c) Find the wavelength $\lambda$ in terms of $L$ and $N$. Check that your
equation reproduces the numbers from part b, and also that it reproduces the
answer of problem \ref{hw:harp-string}a.\hwendpart
(d) Find the frequency in terms of $N$, $v$, and $L$.\answercheck\hwendpart
