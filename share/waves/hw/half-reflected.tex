The expressions for the amplitudes of reflected and transmitted waves
depend on the unitless ratio of the impedances $\alpha$. As described in the text (``duality,'' p.~\pageref{impedance-duality}), the definition of
this ratio is generally somewhat arbitrary, and we can replace $\alpha$ with $1/\alpha$.
Interchanging the roles of the two media also changes $\alpha$ to $1/\alpha$.

The expressions for the amplitudes of reflected and transmitted waves
depend on the unitless ratio $v_2/v_1$ (or, more generally, on the ratio
of the impedances). Call this ratio $\alpha$.

(a) Show that changing $\alpha$ to $1/\alpha$ (e.g., by interchanging the
roles of the two media) has an effect on the reflected amplitude that
can be expressed in a simple way, and discuss what this means in terms
of inversion and energy.
(b) Find the two values of $\alpha$ for which $|R|=1/2$.
